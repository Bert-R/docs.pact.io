You can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwy9Bnco-IpdgdZce-rXeR7EF2_6T8z7S) all of our previous AMA's in case your questions have already been answered.
The questions in each AMA are shown below:

### October 2021

Theme: Test Strategy

Video: https://youtu.be/zKbmpRbPYUg

1. What is integration testing?
1. Writing code for testability
1. Utility of devices such as the testing pyramid to think about crafting a test strategy
1. The benefits and drawbacks of contract testing
1. Approaches to removing the need for end-to-end integrated testing

Audience questions:

1. What are the anti-patterns of contract testing?
1. What's the best approach to start contract testing with limited resources across multiple services?
1. What part of existing testing overhead will Pact contract testing replace?

### September 2021

Theme: Case Study: Rolling out Pact/PactFlow at M1 Finance

Video: https://youtu.be/J6-Zi6noqNE

1. Introduction to M1 finance and case study and existing practices
1. How did you know contract testing was the right fit for the test automation strategy?
1. How did you get started with contract testing?
1. Why did you move to PactFlow?

Audience questions:

1. Have you found a good approach to adding in pact tests to existing software?
1. Finance can be a slow moving domain, has pact so far been able to help with trusting a `can-i-deploy` and not need to plan and schedule manual deployments?
1. Have you managed to impact time spent running other types of tests as a result? e.g. less e2e tests, greater stability of tests etc.?
1. Are you seeing benefits in speed of development yet vs overhead of rolling out additional tests to an existing product, or is there still a way to go?

### August 2021

Theme: Contract Testing with Avro

Video: https://youtu.be/75uA3X2lVqo

1. What is Avro? What is it and what's unique about it?
2. What are the key use cases for it and benefits of using it?
3. What are the challenges with Avro, such as evolving the schema?
4. How do you go about testing Avro?
5. Where does Pact fit in? Does it make sense to combine them?
